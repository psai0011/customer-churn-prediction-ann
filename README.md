# **Customer Churn Prediction using ANN**  

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  

This project is all about predicting **customer churn** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. We've cleaned the dataset, built a deep learning model using **TensorFlow**, and deployed it with **Streamlit** to make it super easy to use!  

## **Whatâ€™s Inside?**  
âœ… **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering** â€“ Processed the raw data to improve model accuracy.  
âœ… **Model Training** â€“ Used **TensorFlow** to build and fine-tune an ANN model.  
âœ… **Deployment** â€“ Hosted the model on **Streamlit** so you can make predictions with a simple UI.  

## **Tech Stack & Libraries Used**  
To make this work, we used:  
- `tensorflow==2.15.0`  
- `pandas` & `numpy` (for data handling)  
- `scikit-learn` (for preprocessing & evaluation)  
- `tensorboard` (for tracking training)  
- `matplotlib` (for visualizations)  
- `streamlit` (for deployment)  
- `scikeras` (for seamless integration with Keras)
