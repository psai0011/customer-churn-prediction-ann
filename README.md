Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
Hey there! 👋

This project is all about predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). We've cleaned the dataset, built a deep learning model using TensorFlow, and deployed it with Streamlit to make it super easy to use!

What’s Inside?
✅ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering – We processed the raw data to improve model accuracy.
✅ Model Training – Used TensorFlow to build and fine-tune an ANN model.
✅ Deployment – Hosted the model on Streamlit so you can make predictions with a simple UI.

Tech Stack & Libraries Used
To make this work, we used:
📌 tensorflow==2.15.0
📌 pandas & numpy (for data handling)
📌 scikit-learn (for preprocessing & evaluation)
📌 tensorboard (for tracking training)
📌 matplotlib (for visualizations)
📌 streamlit (for deployment)
📌 scikeras (for seamless integration with Keras)
